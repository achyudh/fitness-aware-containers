# Fitness Aware Container Brokering
A smart fulfillment engine that automatically deploys a chosen catalogued IT service into a best-available-fit container out of a set of available container engines hosted on various supported underlying clouds

**Note**: *I have not been able to update the repository with the code for the fulfillment engine and this contains only the container deployment and benchmarking code. The fulfillment engine code needs to be rid of private keys, cleaned up, and documented, a time consuming task that I plan to do in the near future.*
